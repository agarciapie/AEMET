## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd weather-dashboard
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables in the `.env` file.

5. Run the application:
   ```
   streamlit run src/app.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can enter a city name to view the meteorological data and its visual representation. The application will display relevant information such as temperature, humidity, and other weather-related metrics.

## Overview

The Weather Dashboard provides an interactive interface for users to explore meteorological data, making it easy to visualize and understand weather patterns across different cities.
